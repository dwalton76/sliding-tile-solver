4-tile puzzle
=============
DONE - rebuild the table using hex
- ./solver.py --solve 3,0,2,1


9-tile puzzle
=============
DONE - stop using IDA
DONE - rebuild the table using hex
- feed it a bogus puzzle but have it detect the puzzle is bogus prior to
  attempting to look it up in the table
- ./solver.py --solve 8,7,6,5,4,1,3,0,2


16-tile puzzle
==============
DONE - rebuild the tables using hex

- Instead of 1-5, 6-10, 11-15 prune table
    - the 1-5 table has ~5.7 million entries and is 20M gzipped
    - do 1-7 and 8-14...those would 518 million entries each and would take about 2G each :(
    - do 1-6, 7-12, and 13-15...those would be 57 million entries each and would take about 230M

- build the main table to 24-deep?
    - today it runs out of memory when doing so


25-tile puzzle
==============
- 25!/2 is a huge number

- Breakdown into 1-6, 7-12, 13-18, 19-24 tables
    - each of these would be 25!/19! or 127,512,000

- Breakdown into 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-24
    - each of these would be 25!/20! or 6,375,600


36-tile puzzle
==============
- 36!/2 is a huge number
- Breakdown into 1-6, 7-12, 13-18, 19-24, 25-30, 31-35 tables
    - each of these would be 36!/30! or 1,402,410,240...that is too large

- Breakdown into 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-35
    - each of these would be 36!/31! or 45,239,040

- Breakdown into 1-4, 5-8, 9-12, 13-16, 17-20, 21-24, 25-28, 29-32, 33-35
    - each of these would be 36!/32! or 1,413,720
